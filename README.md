Try and Play my Baseball Game!!


Guess 3 numbers. If you get all the numbers correct, then it will give you 3 strike. If you guessed right number, but it is not in correct digit(place), then it will say B for ball.

For example, the answer is 285. If you guess 932. Then it is 0S2B because 2 is correct number, but it is not in the first place. If you guess 250, then it is 1S1B because of 2 and 5.
